			<p align="left"> Hello visitor, my name is Mason. A little bit about myself, I was born and raised in Chicago. I have a background in nursing. I would describe myself as a high-spirited, energetic, and optimistic individual. I find great pride and joy when I can help people. It is why I decided to pursue nursing as my first career choice. I decided to go into web development because I found an interest in working with computers. A friend of mine introduced me to Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp. Shortly after getting accepted and starting the program, I see myself becoming a coder more and more each day. Everytime I finished an application, it is very rewarding to see my final product. </p>
